## O que vais fazer

![A machine learning interface testing a model for action recognition. In the center of the screen, a young boy is performing the "Disco" dance move, with one arm pointing upward. On the left side of the screen, the interface displays two possible recognised actions: "Disco" with a 95% certainty score and "Floss" with a 5% certainty score. At the bottom of the interface, a live graph with different colored lines tracks movement data. The interface indicates that the model has accurately identified the boy's action as "Disco" with high confidence. The top of the interface includes the steps: "1. Add data, 2. Train model, 3. Test model."](images/wywm.png)
