## What you will make

![The image shows a machine learning interface testing a model for action recognition. In the center of the screen, a young boy is performing the "Disco" dance move, standing near a window with one arm pointing upward and the other pointing downward. On the left side of the screen, the interface displays two possible recognized actions: "Disco" with a 95% certainty score and "Floss" with a 5% certainty score. At the bottom of the interface, a live graph with different colored lines tracks movement data. The interface indicates that the model has accurately identified the boy's action as "Disco" with high confidence. The top of the interface includes the steps: "1. Add data, 2. Train model, 3. Test model."](images/wywm.png)

Train a computer to help you perfect a dance move!

- This project uses a technology called 'machine learning'. Machine learning systems are trained using a large amount of data. 
- Our projects do not require you to create an account or log in. For our projects, the image examples you use to make the model are only stored temporarily in your browser (only on your machine).
- No images from your webcam are sent to this website or any other website.
